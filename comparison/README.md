# The curious case of Benjamin Benchmarking
As always when benchmarking, we're doing it wrong. Hence timing and size reports will probably favour this library. If you know how to make any case perform better or make the comparisons more accurate - _PLEASE_ do fork, fix and issue a pull request.

## What we're comparing
* Size of the output
* Speed of serializing 2000 repetitions over the same objects
